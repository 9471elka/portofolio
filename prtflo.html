        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I am ELIKANA NYACHAE, a passionate individual who is deeply immersed in the worlds of coding and education. At 21 years old, I have found my heart divided between two loves: programming and teaching.
        Coding is not just a hobby for me, it is a passion that drives me to constantly explore and learn. As a coding student, I am always on the lookout for new technologies and languages to master. Whether it is building a website, crafting a mobile app, or diving into data science, I am eager to tackle any coding challenge that comes my way.
         But my journey does not stop there. In my other role, I am a dedicated mathematics and chemistry teacher. I find immense joy in sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm for these subjects with my students. Whether it is unraveling the mysteries of calculus or conducting experiments in the chemistry lab, every day brings new opportunities to inspire and educate.
        When I am not coding or teaching, you can usually find me lost in a coding project, solving complex math problems, or mixing chemicals in the lab. It is a balancing act between two worlds, but I would not have it any other way. I firmly believe that coding is a tool that empowers us to tackle real-world challenges, and I am excited to be part of that journey.
        So, let us connect and explore the exciting realms of coding and education together. Whether you are a fellow enthusiast or someone looking to learn, I am here to share my passion and knowledge with you. Let us embark on this journey of discovery and growth together!.</p>
